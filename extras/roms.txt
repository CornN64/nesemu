#	The character delimiter of the table above is tab, NOT spaces.
#	Don't erase this characters "*#*" or the emulator will definetly act up since that is the EOF marker.
#
#	You have the option to enable SD Card support (see the platformio.ini file) via "CONFIG_SD_CARD".
#	If you define this variable then also assign the pins for the SPI bus as well. If you do not define this option
#	it will default to SPIFFS on the SRAM, which requires re-flashing the partition to update the files.
#	SD Card support, on the other hand, just requires putting the "roms.txt" file and roms in the root folder of the SD Card.
#	It's also a lot faster.
#
#	Note the four tab-delimited columns.  All four should exist or the menu will not parse correctly.
#	There should be a period after the number, followed by an icon character, name, and file name.
#	The last column should match the ROM file name in the SPIFFS volume.
#	The menu will display the Alphabet (A-z capital & lowercas)
#	Numbers 0-9 and  ? ! . , ( ) -
